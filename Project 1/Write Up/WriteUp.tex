	\section{Introduction}
	\noindent This project explores Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Group members Aguayo, Barnett and Kubota jointly worked on each section.
	
	Given the function $\phi(z)=z^2+c$, where $c\in \C$ is some costant, we consider the problem of finding the fixed points of $\phi(z)$ using an iterative method. The usual process starts with some $z_0\in \C$ and uses the relation $z_{k+1}=\phi(z_k)$ to generate a sequence $\{z_n\}$ which may, or may not, converge to a fixed point of $\phi(z)$, depending on the choice of $z_0$. \\
	\newline
	Julia sets study the set of initial points which generate a sequence that remains bounded. That is, we define the filled Julia set defined by 
	$\{z\in \C: \text{the sequence } z_{k+1}=\phi(z_k), \text{ with initial value } z_0=z, \text{ remains bounded}\}$, and define the Julia set to be the boundary of the filled Julia set.
	\section{Julia Sets}
	
	\subsection{Filled Julia Sets on the Unit Disc}
		We start with the simplest case: $\phi(z)=z^2$, which has two fixed points $u=1$ and $v=0$. Clearly, if $|z_0| \leq 1$, the sequence will converge because $|z_1|=|\phi(z_0)| = |(z_0)^2| \leq 1$, which implies $|z_2|\leq 1$ and so forth. Also, it is clear that if $|z_0|>1$, the sequence will diverge, because the modulus of the following terms will continue to grow. Thus, the filled Julia set for $\phi(z)$ is the unit disc $D^2=\{z: |z|\leq 1\}$, and the Julia set is the boundary of this disc. 
		
	Below is a plot of the set, which was generated with the MATLAB code provided in section \ref{code}.

\subsection{Various Julia Sets} \label{prob2}	
	
	We also graph the Julia set for the function $\phi(z)=z^2+c$, for $c=-1.25,$ $0.36+0.1i,$ $-0.123+0.745i$ and display their graph's below. Note that the code we use to generate these filled Julia sets checks the magnitude of the sequence elements determined by $z_n=\phi(z_{n-1})$. If $|z_n|>2$ for some $n\in \N$, we assume that the sequence is diverging. The algorithm checks all $z_0 \in [-2,2] \times [-2,2]$ region in the complex plane (spaced 0.01 units apart) and plots those which lead to bounded sequences for $z_n$ as red pixels, and those that diverge as white pixels.

\subsection{Boundaries of Filled Julia Sets}\label{prob3}
	We also can form the Julia set by plotting the boundary of the filled Julia sets from section \ref{prob2}. Boundary points are found by noticing that if $\phi(z)=z^2+c$, then $z= \pm \sqrt{\phi(z)-c}$. So, if $z_k = \phi(z_{k-1})$ we get that $z_k= \pm \sqrt{\phi(z_k)-c}=\pm \sqrt{z_{k+1}-c}$, which provides an iterative method to move backwards in the sequences used to generate filled Julia sets. See \ref{JS} for the sample code which generates the boundaries of the filled Julia sets from \ref{prob2}, as shown below.\\

\section{Computing Fractal Dimentions}

\section{Orbits}

While the filled Julia set studies whether or not the initial starting point $z_0$ will produce a bounded or converging sequence $\{z_n\}$ under $\phi$, it can be worthwhile to investigate the sequence $\{z_n\}$ itself. We do this by looking at the orbit of a particular $z_0$, where the orbit (denoted by $orb(z_0)$) is given by the set of all elements in the sequence $\{z_n\}$ generated by $\phi$. 
	
\subsection{Connectedness of the Filled Julia Set}
The complex nature of Julia Sets brings up the question of whether or not the filled Julia set is connected (in the topological sense). Surprisingly, there is a simple necessary and sufficient condition for connectedness. Julia and Fatou showed that the filled Julia set for $\phi(z)=z^s+c$ is connected if, and only if, $0$ is in the filled Julia set. Using this condidtion, we develop an algorithm that checks whether or not the $orb(0)$ for a particular $\phi$ is bounded. Boundedness implies that $0$ is in the filled Julia set for $\phi$, so the set is connected. From an algorithmic standpoint, it is difficult to determine with complete certainty that an orbit is bounded since the orbit may remain bounded for many terms and then diverge, or it might grow quickly and then cycle and remain bounded. So, our algorithm checks the first 1000 terms of $orb(0)$ and if the terms remain bounded by 100, we conclude that $orb(0)$ is bounded. Below is the MATLAB output from our algorithm (see section \ref{orbit}) which checks the boundedness of $orb(0)$
\begin{verbatim}
>> Orb_0(0)
The sequence orb(0) converges to a root; thus, the filled Julia set is connected 
Orb(0) remained bounded for 1000 iterations. We assume the filled set is connected 
>> Orb_0(-1.25)
Orb(0) remained bounded for 1000 iterations. We assume the filled Julia set is connected 
>> Orb_0(0.36+0.1*1i)
Orb(0) remained bounded for 1000 iterations. We assume the filled Julia set is connected 
>> Orb_0(-0.123+745*1i)
The orb(0) is unbounded, so the filled Julia set is not connected 
\end{verbatim}
   
\subsection{Coloring Divergenet Orbits}
We can also study how fast an orbit diverges. We do this by computing the sequence $z_n$ generated by $phi$. When $|z_k|>1000$ for some $k$, we assign a color to the matrix element corresponding the location of $z_k$ in the complex plane. For colors that diverge at similar points in the sequence (I.e for similar $k$ values), the color is similar. Printing this gives a good idea at how fast points near the boundary of the filled Julia set are diverging. Below is the algorithm, and a sample output for $\phi(z)=z^2+0.36+0.1\cdot i$.\\

\section{A Newton's Method Approach}

\section{Mandelbrot Sets}
As opposed to Julia sets which study the boundedness of the sequence $\{z_n\}$ for fixed $\phi$, we can choose to check whether the filled Julia set is connected for varying $\phi$ by changing the constant $c$ values. That is, given $c\in \C$, define $\phi(z)=z^2+c$, and check $orb(0)$ for $phi$. Studying which $c$ produces bounded zero-orbits gives the Mandelbrot set. Below is an image of the Mandelbrot set and an algorithm which computes the set is provided in \ref{mandelbrot}. \\
